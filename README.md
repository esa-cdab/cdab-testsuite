# Repository Traffic 
Since only users with push access to a repository can view its traffic, including full clones (not fetches), visitors from the past 14 days, referring sites, and popular content in the traffic graph,
then this branch is used to store repository traffic and clones past the default 2 week period.

The fields of the clones and views csv files are:

* **total_views**: Views is the total visits of the repository.
* **unique_views**: Unique views refers to the number of individual users who have visited the repository and these are only counted once, regardless of how many times they visit the repository.

* **total_clones**: Cloners refers to people to have cloned or downloaded a copy of the code from GitHub. 
* **unique_clones**: Unique cloners is the number of individual users who have cloned the repository, whereas cloners is the total number of clones.
